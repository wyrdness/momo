      "full": "Momo, short for Missouri Monster, is a Bigfoot-like creature reported primarily in and around Louisiana, Missouri during 1971-1972. Standing 6-7 feet tall and covered in dark, matted fur, Momo gained notoriety through a series of sightings in the summer of 1972. The creature was described as having glowing orange eyes and emitting a powerful, offensive odor. One particularly notable sighting involved the creature carrying what appeared to be a dead dog. While the active sighting period was brief, Momo became a significant part of local legend and small-town cryptid lore. Momo represents one of the Midwest's most famous Bigfoot-type reports, exemplifying the localized \\\"monster flap\\\" phenomenon common in 1970s American cryptozoology."
