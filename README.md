## Overview

Momo, short for Missouri Monster, is a Bigfoot-like creature reported primarily in and around Louisiana, Missouri during 1971-1972. Standing 6-7 feet tall and covered in dark, matted fur, Momo gained notoriety through a series of sightings in the summer of 1972.

The creature was described as having glowing orange eyes and emitting a powerful, offensive odor. One particularly notable sighting involved the creature carrying what appeared to be a dead dog. While the active sighting period was brief, Momo became a significant part of local legend and small-town cryptid lore.

Momo represents one of the Midwest's most famous Bigfoot-type reports, exemplifying the localized "monster flap" phenomenon common in 1970s American cryptozoology.

## Notable Sightings

### Harrison Children Sighting (1972) ⭐

> **Date**: July 11, 1972
> **Location**: Marzolf Hill, Louisiana, Missouri
> **Witnesses**: 3 (Doris, Terry, and Wally Harrison)
> **Evidence**: Contemporary newspaper coverage, consistent testimony

Doris Harrison (8), Terry Harrison (5), and Wally Harrison (5) reported seeing a large, dark, hair-covered creature standing near their family's home on Marzolf Hill. The creature was reportedly carrying what appeared to be a dead dog.

The children ran inside screaming. Their father Edgar Harrison investigated but found no trace of the creature, only an unusual smell lingering in the area. This sighting became the most famous Momo encounter and sparked the media frenzy that followed.

**Credibility Assessment**: Medium — Multiple child witnesses, consistent testimony, no obvious motive for fabrication, though age of witnesses raises questions.

Edgar Harrison, father of the children who reported the July 11 sighting, claimed to have seen the creature on his property. He reported a large, dark figure moving through the wooded area near his home. After the sighting, he discovered unusual three-toed tracks and an area of disturbed vegetation.

## Theories & Explanations

### Cryptozoological Theories

1. **Regional Bigfoot Variant**
   Momo represents a genuine cryptid and Midwestern variant of the broader Bigfoot phenomenon. Multiple independent witnesses and consistent descriptions support this theory.

### Skeptical Explanations

1. **Misidentified Bear**
   Most likely explanation is misidentification of black bears, particularly when standing upright. Black bears are present in Missouri and can match size and coloration descriptions.

2. **Mass Hysteria**
   Community-wide panic following the initial children's report led to copycat sightings. The brief, concentrated time period and abrupt end support this theory.

3. **Hoax**
   Deliberate fabrication, possibly initiated by children's imagination or prank. The suspicious three-toed tracks and lack of physical evidence support this interpretation.

4. **Cultural Contagion**
   Timing coincides with release of "The Legend of Boggy Creek" film (1972) and peak of 1970s monster craze. Similar reports were occurring nationwide during this period.
